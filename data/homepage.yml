  description: "IMMUNOMARK is a project dedicated to advancing cancer research through new technologies and immunotherapy.
  Every euro you donate will go entirely to support this research. <br/><br/>
  Since 2019, we have included more than 400 patients in our study. Our goal is to increase this number ONE MORE with each donation. This will allow us to analyse molecular information and decipher the keys to the use of immunotherapy in the fight against cancer.
  Collaborating in this cause brings research closer to clinical practice and supports the use of precision medicine.
  And above all, it fosters real hope for patients and their families."

  description: "Our cause <b>IMMUNOMARK: ONE MORE</b> has been selected by RealBuzz as a charity associated with the Copenhagen 2024 Half Marathon. 
  Dubbed the 'Home of Charity Running', RealBuzz provides resources and support for runners and charities, with the goal of maximizing the impact of donations raised through running activities.
  <br/><br/>
  Being represented in this race will allow us to break borders and take our cause to an international level. Furthermore, connecting support for scientific research with the running community leads to greater social impact, uniting
  science and sport.

  description: "The IMMUNOMARK project focuses on the integration of molecular analyzes to identify predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy against lung cancer and metastatic melanoma, using both solid and liquid biopsies. 
  It covers analysis at the genomic (DNA mutations), transcriptomic (gene expression) and epigenomic (regulation of gene expression) level.
  <br/><br/>
  To date, the project has contributed significantly to the field of precision immunotherapy, developing new tools and methodologies to predict treatment efficacy. Here we present some publications in international magazines.
  With this fundraising we intend to continue including patients in our study and broaden the scope to include patients with other types of cancer.
