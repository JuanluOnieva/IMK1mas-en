  description: "At IMMUNOMARK, we're dedicated to pioneering advancements in cancer research through innovative technologies and the power of immunotherapy.
  Every euro you contribute will go entirely to support this research. <br/><br/>
  Since our inception in 2019, we've enrolled over 400 patients in our studies. With each donation, our goal is to welcome even more participants. Your support enables us to analyze molecular data, unlocking the potential of immunotherapy in combating cancer. By donating, you help bridge the gap between research and clinical application, promoting the practice of precision medicine.
  Your contribution doesn't just fund research-it fosters real hope for patients and their families."

  description: "Our cause <b>IMMUNOMARK: ONE MORE</b> has been selected by RealBuzz as a charity associated with the Copenhagen 2024 Half Marathon. 
  Dubbed the 'Home of Charity Running', RealBuzz provides resources and support for runners and charities, with the goal of maximizing the impact of donations raised through running activities.
  <br/><br/>
  Being represented in this race will allow us to break borders and take our cause to an international level. Furthermore, connecting support for scientific research with the running community leads to greater social impact, uniting
  science and sport.

  description: "The IMMUNOMARK project focuses on the integration of molecular analyses to identify predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy against lung cancer and metastatic melanoma.
  We utilise both solid and liquid biopsies to conduct comprehensive analyses at the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic levels—examining DNA mutations, gene expression, and gene expression regulation, respectively.
  <br/><br/>
  To date, the project has contributed significantly to the field of precision immunotherapy, developing new tools and methodologies to predict treatment efficacy. Here we present some publications in international scientifc journals.
  With this fundraising we intend to continue including patients in our study and broaden the scope to include also other types of cancer.
